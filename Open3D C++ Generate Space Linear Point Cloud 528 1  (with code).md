##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

  By knowing the direction vector of a point and a straight line on a straight line, a standard straight line point cloud for algorithm testing can be generated according to mathematical principles. In the following example code, a point on a straight line is used as the center point to generate a spatial straight line point cloud, where the number of points is 100 and the interval between adjacent points is 0.1m.

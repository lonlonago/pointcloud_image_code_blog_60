##  I. Overview 

  Open3D's built-in farthest point sampling function Open3D (C++) FPS farthest point downsampling does not perform multi-threaded acceleration, and the sampling efficiency is low when the amount of point cloud data is large. On the basis of analyzing the principle of the algorithm and the source code, this paper gives the multi-threaded accelerated version of the C++ Open3D code implementation.

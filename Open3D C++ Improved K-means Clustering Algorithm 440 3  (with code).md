   The principle of the classical Kmeans algorithm is introduced in: PCL Kmeans point cloud clustering. Since the traditional Kmeans algorithm randomly selects the cluster center point, the clustering failure may occur. Therefore, the point selection strategy is improved, so that the probability of the algorithm success is greatly improved. As shown in the figure below, the traditional algorithm will divide the street lamp into two, and the improved classification is more accurate.

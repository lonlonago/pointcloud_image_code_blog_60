##  First, the coordinate maximum value 

  Obtaining the maximum and minimum values of point cloud coordinates is a very important operation in many point cloud processing algorithms. C++ version of Open3D can directly call numpy to find the maximum value unlike python. Therefore, this paper gives three methods for finding the maximum value of point cloud coordinates on the basis of learning the C++ 11 standard library, in order to deal with various development environments.

##  III. Eigen implementation 

Open3D is highly integrated with Eigen, and the preservation of coordinates and point clouds relies on Eigen :: Vector 3d and std :: vector.

##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

###  1. Overview of the principle 

  This paper presents a simple and fast operator, the "hidden" point removal operator, which determines the visible point in a point cloud from a given viewpoint. Visibility is determined without reconstructing the surface or estimating the normal. The results show that extracting the point located on the convex hull of the transformed point cloud is equivalent to determining the visible point. The operator is generic - it can be applied to point clouds in various dimensions, point clouds on point clouds, and viewpoints inside and outside point clouds. The results show that the operator is useful in point cloud visualization, viewpoint-dependent reconstruction, and shadow casting.

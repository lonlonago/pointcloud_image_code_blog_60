##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

  There are many ways to generate a spherical point cloud. Marsaglia proposed a simple and easy implementation in 1972. It selects the sum from the independent uniform distribution over (-1, 1) and culls the points. From the remaining points, namely: 

 It is uniformly distributed on the surface of the unit sphere.
